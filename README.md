# Cycloidal Motion Cam Profile Analysis

This MATLAB script analyzes the kinematics (displacement, velocity, and acceleration) of a cam-follower system using a cycloidal motion profile. It is configured for a valve system with both Low-Lift and High-Lift modes.

## Features

- Calculates follower and valve motion based on cycloidal rise and return equations.
- Generates plots for displacement, velocity, and acceleration for both follower and valve.
- Compares Low-Lift and High-Lift profiles.
- Outputs a summary of maximum kinematic values and their corresponding cam angles.

## How to Run

1.  Open `marchinery_s.m` in MATLAB.
2.  Adjust parameters in the "ค่าคงที่และพารามิเตอร์" section if needed (e.g., `L_low`, `L_high`, `omega_val`).
3.  Run the script. The plots will be generated, and a summary table will be printed in the Command Window.
